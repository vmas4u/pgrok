## What is pgrok?

pgrok is a reverse proxy that creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to a locally running web service.
pgrok captures and analyzes all traffic over the tunnel for later inspection and replay.

## What can I do with pgrok?

- Expose any http service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet on a subdomain of ejemplo.me
- Expose any tcp service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet on a random port of ejemplo.me
- Inspect all http requests/responses that are transmitted over the tunnel
- Replay any request that was transmitted over the tunnel

## What is pgrok useful for?

- Temporarily sharing a website that is only running on your development machine
- Demoing an app at a hackathon without deploying
- Developing any services which consume webhooks (HTTP callbacks) by allowing you to replay those requests
- Debugging and understanding any web service by inspecting the HTTP traffic
- Running networked services on machines that are firewalled off from the internet
